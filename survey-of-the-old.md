# Survey of the Old Testament I

## Lesson 1: Introduction to O.T.

### The Revelation of the Old Testament Sriptures
- The old testament reveals the true and living God
- Do we accept what GOds word says about the event, or humanistic ideas about what the bible says?

- Without a reliable authority those are just ideas


### The Reasons for Stutdying Old Testament
- If we don't teach and preach the old testament we don't see all the prophesies of Christ
- We don't see a clear picture of who God really is

### Relationship Between Old and New

- They complete one another, not antagonistic
- Hebrews 1:1-3
- The prophets God sent were rejected by the people God sent them too, just like Jesus
